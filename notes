Yes, there are several other frameworks, formats, templates, and "languages" designed to describe requirements, processes, or behaviors in a structured, yet natural language or semi-formal way. Here are some notable examples beyond Gherkin, User Stories, and SMART:

1. Given-When-Then (GWT)
Closely related to Gherkin, it's a pattern for writing acceptance criteria in behavior-driven development (BDD).
2. Use Case Narratives / Templates
Structured descriptions of system interactions, often using templates like "Actor does X, System responds with Y".
3. INVEST
A set of criteria for writing good User Stories: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.
4. MoSCoW Method
Prioritization framework: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have.
5. Job Stories
"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]".
6. Feature Injection
"In order to [business value], as a [role], I want [feature]".
7. Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) Formats
Natural language formats for acceptance criteria, sometimes using tables or scenario outlines.
8. Planguage
A precise, semi-formal language for requirements specification, created by Tom Gilb.
9. FURPS/FURPS+
Framework for classifying requirements: Functionality, Usability, Reliability, Performance, Supportability (+ others).
10. Scenario Mapping / Event Storming
Visual and textual approaches to describing processes and requirements.
11. RUP Use Case Templates
Rational Unified Process (RUP) provides structured templates for use cases.
12. Structured English / Pseudocode
Used in business analysis to describe processes in a controlled subset of English.
13. BDD Tools Languages (besides Gherkin)
Cucumber, SpecFlow, JBehave, etc., each with their own flavor of scenario description.
14. Decision Tables & Trees
Tabular or tree-based formats for specifying rules and outcomes.
15. 5W1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)
A questioning framework for requirements elicitation and documentation.
If you are interested in a particular context (e.g., software requirements, business process modeling, testing), let me know and I can tailor the list or provide examples for each!


ertainly! Here’s a detailed overview of major frameworks, formats, templates, and “languages” used to describe requirements and processes in a structured, yet natural language or semi-formal way. I’ll organize them by their primary context (software requirements, business analysis, process modeling, testing, etc.), and provide examples or key characteristics for each.

1. Software Requirements & User Needs
a. User Stories
Format: As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [reason].
Purpose: Captures a feature from the end-user’s perspective.
Best For: Agile development, backlog items.
Example: As a registered user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access if I forget it.
b. INVEST Criteria (for User Stories)
Acronym: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.
Purpose: Ensures User Stories are well-formed and actionable.
c. Job Stories
Format: When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].
Purpose: Focuses on context and motivation, not personas.
Example: When I forget my password, I want to receive a reset link, so I can access my account again.
d. Feature Injection
Format: In order to [achieve some value], as a [role], I want [feature].
Purpose: Makes the business value explicit.
Example: In order to reduce support calls, as a user, I want to reset my password online.
e. MoSCoW Prioritization
Categories: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have (this time).
Purpose: Prioritizes requirements for releases.
2. Structured Process & Behavior Description
a. Gherkin / Given-When-Then (GWT)
Format: Given [context], When [event], Then [outcome].
Purpose: Describes scenarios for BDD (Behavior-Driven Development).
Example:
CopyInsert
Given a user is logged in
When they request a password reset
Then they receive a reset email
Tools: Cucumber, SpecFlow, Behave, JBehave.
b. Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)
Format: Natural language, often tabular or scenario-based.
Purpose: Defines acceptance criteria before development.
Example: See Gherkin above.
c. Use Case Narratives / Templates
Format: Actor, Precondition, Main Flow, Alternate Flows, Postcondition.
Purpose: Documents system interactions in detail.
Example:
Actor: User
Precondition: User has an account
Main Flow: User enters email, system sends reset link, etc.
d. Rational Unified Process (RUP) Use Case Templates
Format: Structured template with sections for actors, triggers, flows, exceptions, etc.
Purpose: Standardizes use case documentation in RUP methodology.
3. Requirements Specification & Analysis
a. Planguage
Creator: Tom Gilb
Purpose: Precise, quantifiable requirements using a controlled vocabulary.
Example:
CopyInsert
Security.Level: Must resist 99.99% of unauthorized access attempts per year.
b. FURPS/FURPS+
Acronym: Functionality, Usability, Reliability, Performance, Supportability (+ others: Design, Implementation, Interface, Physical).
Purpose: Categorizes requirements for completeness.
c. 5W1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)
Purpose: Ensures all aspects of a requirement or process are considered.
Example: Who needs the feature? What does it do? When is it used? etc.
4. Business Process Modeling & Analysis
a. Structured English / Pseudocode
Purpose: Describes logic/processes in a controlled, semi-formal subset of English.
Example: IF user is logged in THEN allow password reset.
b. Scenario Mapping / Event Storming
Purpose: Visual and textual mapping of business processes, often with sticky notes or diagrams.
Example: Steps in a customer journey, mapped out with events and actions.
c. Decision Tables & Trees
Format: Tabular or tree diagrams showing conditions and resulting actions.
Purpose: Clarifies complex business rules.
Example: | Condition A | Condition B | Action | |-------------|-------------|------------| | Yes | No | Action 1 | | No | Yes | Action 2 |
5. Testing & Quality Assurance
a. BDD Tool Languages
Examples: Gherkin (Cucumber), SpecFlow, JBehave, Behave.
Purpose: Write executable specifications in natural language.
b. Acceptance Criteria (Custom Formats)
Format: Lists or bullet points describing what must be true for a feature to be accepted.
Example:
The user receives a reset email within 5 minutes.
The reset link expires after 24 hours.
6. Miscellaneous & Supporting Frameworks
a. Event-Condition-Action (ECA) Rules
Format: When [event] and [condition], do [action].
Purpose: Used in business rules engines and process automation.
b. S.M.A.R.T. Goals
Acronym: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
Purpose: Ensures goals (including requirements) are clear and actionable.
