# Business Model Canvas

Initial options was though to be implemented as a set of forms, like a wizard but after a brainstorming session, the team decided to follow a different approach.
We will implement this using a text based template that the user will fill-in.
This will give a better experience as it will work like a document that we asume users have already created somewhere during business research or user research.
A document has also the advantage of allowing users to freely move up and down the content maknig changes in different sections without leaving the document, this cannot easily be done using a wizard or other form based approach.

On the technical side, this will serve as an opportunity for the engineering team to spike the text interpreter that can be used down the road for other features.
